In order to compile your c program, you will need a c compiler.

gcc is the most common and is already installed on thoth.

to compile a c file named test.c :
	gcc test.c -o test

this will create an executable named test
to run the executable:
	./test


on thoth, create a copy of hello.c and compile and run it.
(alternatively you can create it on your own machine and push it to thoth)
