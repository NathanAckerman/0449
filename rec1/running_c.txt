In order to compile your c program, you will need a c compiler.

gcc is the most common and is already installed on thoth.

to compile a c file named test.c :
	gcc test.c -o test

this will create an executable named test
to run the executable:
	./test

try compiling example0.c and running it on thoth.
to download this repo onto thoth you can use git:
	git clone https://github.com/NathanAckerman/0449.git

read example0.c to see what it is doing and compare that with the output.
