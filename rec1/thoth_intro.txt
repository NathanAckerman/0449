In this class we will be using thoth for labs.

Thoth is a server hosted at pitt running Linux v2.6.

The hostname is thoth.cs.pitt.edu

You can connect to thoth via an ssh session (secure shell).
This gives you a command line interface to thoth.

If connecting from linux/mac:
	use bash and enter the command
	ssh username@thoth.cs.pitt.edu
If connecting from windows:
	download putty and use that with the thoth's hostname and your username

The first time logging in, it will ask you to confirm a key. Say yes.

You can edit files directly on thoth via any command line editor (vim, emacs, nano, pico).
If you wish to use an editor on your local machine, you can use an ftp client to edit
the files locally and push the changed files to thoth for testing.
On Linux/Mac/Windows you can use FileZilla. On Windows you can also use WinSCP.

You can manually move files between your local machine and thoth via the scp command (bash).
Local to Thoth:
	scp file_to_transfer username@thoth.cs.pitt.edu:~/path_from_home_directory
Thoth to Local
	scp username@thoth.cs.pitt.edu:~/path_from_home_directory_to_file local_storage_path

Many editors/IDEs also have ftp plugins which can manage this for you.



If you want to quickly edit some files on thoth but have not set up any ftp and don't
have experience with command line editors, you may want to use nano for the following. 
nano does not have that many features but it is the simplest of the editors on thoth.

From your home directory on thoth (cd ~):
	chmod u+rw .bash_profile

To use nano to edit files:
	nano .bash_profile (opens file in the editor)
	--make changes to file here
	ctrl+o to save
	--press enter to confirm filename
	ctrl+x to exit nano

To get man pages to work on thoth:
Edit ~/.bash_profile and add this to the end

if [ "$HOSTNAME" = "thoth.cs.pitt.edu" ]; then 
	source /opt/set_specific_profile.sh;
fi



Sometimes command line colors dont work out of the box via ssh.
Add this to your .bash_profile on thoth to have colors.
(atleast if you are ssh'ing from bash, no promises for putty)

export PS1="[\[\033[1;32m\]\h\[\033[0m\] \[\033[1;34m\]\w\[\033[0m\]]: ";
